/// Advances a vehicle along its planned route.
///
/// # Arguments
///
/// * `vehicle` - A mutable reference to the vehicle to be moved.
/// * `route` - A mutable vector of intersections representing the vehicle's planned route.  
///             The first element is the current intersection and the next element is the next destination.
/// * `grid` - Reference to the traffic grid (used for checking intersection states).
/// * `lanes` - Mutable reference to the collection of lanes (used to update occupancy).
///
/// # Returns
///
/// * `true` if the vehicle successfully moved to the next intersection.
/// * `false` if the vehicle could not move (due to a red light, lane congestion, or no available lane).
///
/// # Behavior
///
/// - For non-emergency vehicles:
///     - The function checks the lane's available space (using vehicle length vs. lane length).
///     - If the current intersection is controlled by a traffic light and its state is Red, the vehicle waits.
/// - For emergency vehicles:
///     - They ignore red lights and capacity limits; the laneâ€™s emergency flag is set during movement.
